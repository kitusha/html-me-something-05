            <h2>My Personal Story</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Kitusha Born and raised in Kenya, East Africa. I come from a family of six with four siblings.
                Sadly, my father passed away in 2004 from Diabetes. He discovered his condition at a very crucial stage,
                but it was too late to manage it effectively. Losing him at such an early age was heartbreaking, and I
                still miss him dearly. However, life goes on, and I carry his memory in my heart as I continue my journey.

            <h2>Places I Have Visited</h2>
            <p>
                In Kenya, I have had the opportunity to visit some incredible places. I've explored game parks teeming
                with wildlife, vibrant cities, majestic waterfalls, and fascinating caves. Kenya is renowned for its
                tourism attractions, and its people have excelled in sports, particularly in marathon running and short
                distance events.

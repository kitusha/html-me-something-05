        <h1>KITUSHA BIOGRAPHY</h1>
      </header>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
        <p>My name is Kitusha. I was born and raised in Kenya, East Africa, in a family of six with four siblings.
        My mother and dad were married until my dad passed away in 2004 from Diabetes. My dad discovered he had diabetes at a very crucial stage, so he tried to manage it, but it was very late, which took his life. He died at an early age, and I still miss him, but life has to go on anyways.</p>
